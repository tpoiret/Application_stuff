Dear Dr. Len,\\

My name is Thibault Poiret and I would like to apply for the postdoctoral position you advertised, related to constructing moduli spaces for Prym varieties and their tropicalizations.

I completed my PhD in algebraic geometry at the universities of Bordeaux and Leiden under the supervision of Prof. Qing Liu and Prof. Bas Edixhoven, working on NÃ©ron models over bases of arbitrary dimension, with a particular emphasis on families of prestable curves. I am now a postdoctoral fellow in Cambridge, in the group of Dr. Dhruv Ranganathan. Prestable curves, their tropicalizations and their moduli have been the most central object in my research so far; and I think my experience in working on the logarithmic and tropical Jacobians will be particularly relevant in thinking about the moduli of Prym varieties. This is a topic I have already had some interesting conversations about, and I would like to explore it more seriously.

In the past, I have worked both on autonomous and collaborative projects. Exchanging ideas with others is my favourite part of the job. As a consequence, I am enthusiastic about being an active participant in seminars and working groups. In research as in teaching, I treat the question of how to communicate ideas in the clearest way possible with the seriousness it deserves.


I hope you will consider this application, and give me this opportunity to learn many new and interesting things.\\

Best regards,

Thibault Poiret

Dear Prof. Ranganathan,\\

My name is Thibault Poiret and I would like to apply for the postdoctoral position you advertised, related to curve counting, moduli, and logarithmic geometry.

I completed my PhD in algebraic geometry at the universities of Bordeaux and Leiden under the supervision of Prof. Qing Liu and Prof. Bas Edixhoven, investigating different aspects of the theory of NÃ©ron models in arbitrary base dimension. I have some experience working with moduli spaces; toric geometry; log and tropical geometry. I am entirely willing to explore things outside of my areas of expertise as well. In parallel of the research, I also taught at both universities: I like both aspects of the job, and I am very determined to continue working in academia. Research-wise, I have obtained results both by working autonomously and by collaborating with others. I am fully aware that communicating with other mathematicians, writing clearly and succintly and finding connections with other people's research is an important part of the job, and I am enthusiastic about being an active participant in seminars and working groups.

I hope you will consider this application, and give me this opportunity to learn many new and interesting things.\\

Best regards,

Thibault Poiret
